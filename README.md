In this project let's build a Tasty Kitchens App by applying the concepts we have learned till now.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using component lifecycle methods, routing concepts, authentication, and authorization, and adding responsiveness to the website. Implemented a responsive Online Food Ordering System like Swiggy/Zomato where users can see popular restaurants with sort by rating, specific restaurant details, adding or removing food items to cart, and payments section.

Implemented different routes for features like login, home, specific restaurant details, cart by using React Router components Route, Switch, Link.
Implemented horizontal scrolling (carousel images on the home page) using React Third Party library called React Slick.
Used Figma mockups to implement UI-rich and pixel-perfect React components.
Used fetch to call REST APIs for popular restaurants with sort by, specific restaurant details.
Implemented username and password authentication and persisted login state using client storage.
Implemented a protected route to ensure only authenticated users can access the pages like home, specific restaurant details, etc.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Bootstrap, React Slick, Figma, client storage.
